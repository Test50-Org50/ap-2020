# E. A to E

## Problem Setup

- login to [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.dev)
- write `cd` in the *terminal* to go to the home directory
- write `mkdir a-to-e` to create a folder called `a-to-e`
- write `cd a-to-e` to go to the `a-to-e` folder
- write `code a-to-e.cpp` to create a file called `a-to-e.cpp` and open it in the editor

## Problem

Given a string \\(S\\) and its size \\(N\\), determine if it only consists of characters from 'a' to 'e'.

## Input

The first line contains the size of the string \\(N\\) (\\(1 \\leq N \\leq 2000\\)).

The second line contains the string \\(S\\) of size \\(N\\) consisting of lower case English letters.

## Output

Print a single line containing YES if \\(S\\) consists only of characters from 'a' to 'e'; otherwise, print NO.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

```text
3
ace
```

**Output:**

```text
YES
```

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

```text
5
hello
```

**Output:**

```text
NO
```
