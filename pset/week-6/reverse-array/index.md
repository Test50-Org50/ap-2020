# G. Reverse Array

## Problem Setup

- login to [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.dev)
- write `cd` in the *terminal* to go to the home directory
- write `mkdir reverse-array` to create a folder called `reverse-array`
- write `cd reverse-array` to go to the `reverse-array` folder
- write `code reverse-array.cpp` to create a file called `reverse-array.cpp` and open it in the editor

## Problem

You are given an array \\(A\\) of \\(n\\) numbers. Your task is to print it in reverse order.

## Input

First line has one integer \\(n\\): array size: (\\(1 \\leq n \\leq 1000\\)).

Second line has array \\(A\\) of \\(n\\) integers: (\\(1 \\leq A_i \\leq 1000\\)).

## Output

Print array \\(A\\) in reverse order.

## Example

**Input:**

```text
5
2 6 9 7 3
```

**Output:**

```text
3 7 9 6 2
```

## Test Your Code
