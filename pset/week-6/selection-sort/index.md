# E. Selection Sort

## Problem Setup

- login to [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.dev)
- write `cd` in the *terminal* to go to the home directory
- write `mkdir selection-sort` to create a folder called `selection-sort`
- write `cd selection-sort` to go to the `selection-sort` folder
- write `code selection-sort.cpp` to create a file called `selection-sort.cpp` and open it in the editor

## Problem

You are given an array \\(A\\) of \\(n\\) numbers, print it after sorting its elements in ascending order.

**Note:** You must use the **Selection Sort Algorithm**; any other technique will be rejected.

## Input

First line has one integer \\(n\\) : size of the array: (\\(1 \\leq n \\leq 1000\\)).

Second line has \\(n\\) integers : the array \\(A\\) : (\\(1 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^9\\)).

## Output

Print array \\(A\\) after sorting it in ascending order.

## Example

**Input:**

```text
5
3 6 1 10 5
```

**Output:**

```text
1 3 5 6 10
```
