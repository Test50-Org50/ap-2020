# H. Get Second Maximum

## Problem Setup

- login to [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.dev)
- write `cd` in the *terminal* to go to the home directory
- write `mkdir second-maximum` to create a folder called `second-maximum`
- write `cd second-maximum` to go to the `second-maximum` folder
- write `code second-maximum.cpp` to create a file called `second-maximum.cpp` and open it in the editor

## Problem

You are given an array \\(A\\) of \\(n\\) numbers; your task is to print the second greatest value in the array \\(A\\).

## Input

First line has one integer \\(n\\) : size of the array \\(A\\) : (\\(2 \\leq n \\leq 1000\\)).

Second line has array \\(A\\) of \\(n\\) **distinct** numbers: (\\(1 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^5\\)).

## Output

Print the second greatest value in the array \\(A\\).

## Examples

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

```text
5
