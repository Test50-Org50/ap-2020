## Problem

Given an array of \\(n\\) integers, find the minimum element in the array.

## Input

First line: \\(n\\) where \\(1 \\leq n \\leq 100\\), the number of elements in the array.

Second line: \\(n\\) integers \\(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n\\) where \\(-10^4 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^4\\), the elements of the array.

## Output

Print the minimum element in the array.
