# E. Palindrome

## Problem Setup

- login to [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.dev)
- write `cd` in the *terminal* to go to the home directory
- write `mkdir palindrome` to create a folder called `palindrome`
- write `cd palindrome` to go to the `palindrome` folder
- write `code palindrome.cpp` to create a file called `palindrome.cpp` and open it in the editor

## Problem

Given a string \\(S\\). Determine whether \\(S\\) is **Palindrome** or **not**

**Note:** A string is said to be a **palindrome** if **the reverse** of the string is **same** as the string. 

For example, "abba" is **palindrome**, but "abbc" is **not palindrome**.

## Input

Only one line contains a string \\(S\\) (\\(1 \\leq \|S\| \\leq 1000\\)) where \|S\| is the length of the string and it consists of **lowercase** letters only.

## Output

Print "**YES**" if the string is **palindrome**, otherwise print "**NO**".

## Examples

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

```text
abba
```

**Output:**

```text
YES
```

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

```text
itics50
```

**Output:**

```text
NO
```

**Example 3:**

**Input:**

```text
mam
```

**Output:**

```text
YES
```
