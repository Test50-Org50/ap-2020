# D. Simple Operations

## Problem Setup
- login to [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.dev)
- write `cd` in the *terminal* to go to the home directory
- write `mkdir operations` to create a folder called `operations`
- write `cd operations` to go to the `operations` folder
- write `code operations.cpp` to create a file called `operations.cpp` and open it in the editor

## Problem

You are given two integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Print the results of:

1. \\(a + b\\)
2. \\(a - b\\)
3. \\(a \\times b\\)
4. \\(a / b\\)

## Input

One line containing two integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) where \\(1 \\leq a, b \\leq 10^8\\).

## Output

Print four lines:
1. The result of \\(a + b\\)
2. The result of \\(a - b\\)
3. The result of \\(a \\times b\\)
4. The result of \\(a / b\\) (integer division)

## Examples

**Example 1:**

Input:
```
10 2
```

Output:
```
12
8
20
5
```
