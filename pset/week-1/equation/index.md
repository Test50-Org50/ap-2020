# B. Equation

## Problem Setup
- login to [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.dev)
- write `cd` in the *terminal* to go to the home directory
- write `mkdir equation` to create a folder called `equation`
- write `cd equation` to go to the `equation` folder
- write `code equation.cpp` to create a file called `equation.cpp` and open it in the editor

## Problem

You are given \\(4\\) integers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\). You need to calculate the value of \\(z = a \\times b + c - d\\), where \\(z\\) is the result of the calculation.

## Input

One line containing four integers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) where \\(1 \\leq a, b, c, d \\leq 1000\\).

## Output

Print the value of \\(z\\) in a single line, where \\(z = a \\times b + c - d\\).

## Example

Input:
```
4 2 5 3
```

Output:
```
10
```
