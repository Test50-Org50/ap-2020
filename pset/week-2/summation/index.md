# B. Summation

## Problem Setup
- login to [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.dev)
- write `cd` in the *terminal* to go to the home directory
- write `mkdir summation` to create a folder called `summation`
- write `cd summation` to go to the `summation` folder
- write `code summation.cpp` to create a file called `summation.cpp` and open it in the editor

## Problem

Given \\(n\\) integers, you need to calculate the sum of all of them.

## Input

The first line contains an integer \\(n\\) where \\(1 \\leq n \\leq 100\\) — the number of integers.

The second line contains \\(n\\) integers \\(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n\\) where \\(-100 \\leq a_i \\leq 100\\) — the integers.

## Output

Print the sum of all integers.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

**Input:**
```
5
2 4 3 1 5
```

**Output:**
```
15
